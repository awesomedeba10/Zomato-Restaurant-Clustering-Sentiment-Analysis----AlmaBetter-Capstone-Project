Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company founded by Deepinder Goyal, Pankaj Chaddah, and Gunjan Patidar in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus, and user reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities. Zomato had also made a name for itself for its prowess in digital marketing.

Like most other startups, India‚Äôs pioneering food tech unicorn Zomato has seen many peaks and troughs in its journey. While there were some illustrious moments and accomplishments, there were troubled times too, some that even brought the very existence of the company into question. While Zomato competes with Swiggy, UberEats, and Ola-Foodpanda among others, the company continues to innovate offerings and expand in the manner it has been doing since the day it all started.

Sharing on the internet is something we usually do. Giving a review is also a useful activity so that other people on the internet can find out something else and see opinions about things.
